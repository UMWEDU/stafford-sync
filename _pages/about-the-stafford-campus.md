The UMW Stafford Campus opened in the fall of 1999 as the university’s second campus specifically designed for mid-life professionals seeking academic degree and professional development programs. With the addition of the North Building in January 2007, the campus quickly became the region’s premier venue for educational programs and professional conferences and meetings. Each 40,000 square foot building houses classrooms, computer labs, executive conference rooms, faculty and staff offices as well as attractive public areas. The striking North Building atrium and 2,700 square foot divisible University Hall with a catering kitchen and IT/AV control room accommodates up to 250 guests seated theater-style and up to 200 guests seated banquet/meeting style. State-of-the-art instructional technology systems, video conferencing capabilities, and wired and wireless internet access are available throughout the buildings that host upwards of 150 professional events each year in addition to academic classes and professional development programs for educators and business professionals.

Both buildings are ADA-compliant and were recently certified as a Virginia Green Facility by the Department of Environmental Quality. Designed to meet LEED Certification requirements, the North Building features low-maintenance landscaping, designated alternative fuel vehicle parking spaces, and several other environmentally-friendly features.
